# Case Test - PlayKids & Leiturinha <3

This project was build having in mind the test proposed by the PlayKids team.

### Starting

The objective of this guide is to help you have a 100% working copy of this project.

I am using Linux. If you are on Windows OS, there is no need to run 'sudo' in the commands provided below.

### Requirement

To run this project you only need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installing

To install Docker, please follow the instructions on this website:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are
  isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

Also install:

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your
  applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Running the Project

First, open a terminal at the project root folder (pk-lojinha) and run:

```npm install```

Inside this project there is a folder called [Laradock](http://laradock.io/). Laradock is a full PHP development environment for Docker.
Let's start a few containers needed to run our project.
Open a terminal into that folder and type: (be aware, this will take a while)
``` 
sudo docker-compose up -d nginx mysql phpmyadmin
```

Enter in our project workspace. Type at this same terminal:

```sudo docker-compose exec --user=laradock workspace bash```

Now run

```composer install && npm run dev```

Create the database using the phpmyadmin docker container, it needs to be in ```utf8mb4_unicode_ci```. Visit ```localhost:1010``` to access PhpMyAdmin.

Now make a copy of the ```.env.example``` file inside the root folder and call it just ```.env```

Edit you .env file with the database name. 

In order to be able to use the credit card payment at the payment screen,
you must create a stripe account, access your test dashboard and get some values into our .env file.

Now got back to our open terminal and run the migration and seeding. You will have a few data into your database already. Type:

```php artisan migrate && php artisan db:seed```

To access the server, please enter this ip address at your browser:
```localhost:8888```

### Observations
If for any reason you are unable to access phpmyadmin, try to 'down' your docker containers with ```sudo docker-compose down``` 
and up again with ```sudo docker-compose up -d nginx mysql phpmyadmin```. This is a particularity i found, could be only on my system
but who knows, right? (:

### Project Screenshots

Here is the Landing page. The first Page the user will see upon entering our store.
Few products are random generated with a base image, categories, name, description and price.

Upon clicking at an item, this page with details of the product will open. Here you can add the item to your cart.
Here in this screenshot I have already added a couple items to our cart.

Here is the cart page. You can see the items you want to buy, how many of it and you can also remove items.
Below your items you can see the price total already formatted to BRL.
In this store model the user does not need an account to buy. It only needs to provide valid data and a valid credit card.
I integrated our store with Stripe and used for this screenshot Stripe Test data.
