### Requirement

To run this project you only need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installing

To install Docker, please follow the instruction on this website:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are
  isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

Also install:

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your
  applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Running the Project

Inside this project there is a folder called [Laradock](http://laradock.io/). Laradock is a full PHP development environment for Docker. Open a terminal into that folder and type:

``` 
sudo docker-compose up -d nginx mysql phpmyadmin
```

I am using Linux. If you are on Windows OS, there is no need to run with 'sudo'. This command will start a few Docker containers needed for the project. Everything is configured inside the Laradoc
folder

To access the server, please enter this ip address:
