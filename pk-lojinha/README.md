# Case Test - PlayKids & Leiturinha <3

This project was build having in mind the test proposed by the PlayKids team.

### Starting

The objective of this guide is to help you have a 100% working copy of this project.

I am using Linux. If you are on Windows OS, there is no need to run 'sudo' in the commands provided below.

### Requirement

To run this project you only need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installing

To install Docker, please follow the instructions on this website:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are
  isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

Also install:

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your
  applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Running the Project

First, open a terminal at the project root folder (pk-lojinha) and run:

```npm install```

Inside this project there is a folder called [Laradock](http://laradock.io/). Laradock is a full PHP development environment for Docker.
Let's start a few containers needed to run our project.
Open a terminal into that folder and type: (be aware, this will take a while)
``` 
sudo docker-compose up -d nginx mysql phpmyadmin
```

Enter in our project workspace. Type at this same terminal:

```sudo docker-compose exec --user=laradock workspace bash```

Now run

```composer install && npm run dev```

Create the database using the phpmyadmin docker container, it needs to be in ```utf8mb4_unicode_ci```. Visit ```localhost:1010``` to access PhpMyAdmin.

Now make a copy of the ```.env.example``` file inside the root folder and call it just ```.env```

Edit you .env file with the database name. 

In order to be able to use the credit card payment at the payment screen,
you must create a stripe account, access your test dashboard and get some values into our .env file.

Now got back to our open terminal and run the migration and seeding. You will have a few data into your database already. Type:

```php artisan migrate && php artisan db:seed```

To access the server, please enter this ip address at your browser:
```localhost:8888```

### Observations
If for any reason you are unable to access phpmyadmin, try to 'down' your docker containers with ```sudo docker-compose down``` 
and up again with ```sudo docker-compose up -d nginx mysql phpmyadmin```. This is a particularity i found, could be only on my system
but who knows, right? (:
